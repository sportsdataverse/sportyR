\description{
The goal crease is the area where a goaltender plays their position. It is
comprised of two components: the outline of the crease (see
\code{\link[=hockey_goal_crease_outline]{hockey_goal_crease_outline()}}), and the filling in its boundary. The goal
crease may have two notches (one on each side of the line y = 0)
}
\details{
The filling of the goal crease should have thickness given by
'minor_line_thickness', as this refers to the crease's outline, which is a
minor line on the ice surface. The goal crease's filling is usually light in
color
