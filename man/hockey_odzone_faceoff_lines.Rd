\arguments{
\item{feature_thickness}{The thickness of the faceoff lines}

\item{faceoff_line_dist_x}{The distance from the center of the faceoff spot
to the interior edge of the faceoff lines in the x direction}

to the interior edge of the faceoff lines in the y direction}

\item{faceoff_line_length}{The length of the faceoff lines from the edge
nearest the goal line to the edge nearest the end boards}

nearest the center of the spot to the edge nearest the side boards}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the bounding coordinates of the
offensive/defensive zone faceoff lines
}
\description{
The offensive/defensive zone faceoff lines are the L-shaped lines where
players on each team line up when taking a faceoff in either the offensive or
defensive zones. There are four of these faceoff lines around each
offensive/defensive faceoff spot
}
\details{
These lines are L-shaped, but can be thought of as two rectangles with
thickness given by 'minor_line_thickness', and are usually red in color
