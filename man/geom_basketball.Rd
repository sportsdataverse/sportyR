\item{court_updates}{A list of updates to the courts' parameters. These will
overwrite the parameters of the league}

\item{color_updates}{A list of updates to the courts' default colors, which
are set by \code{\link[=basketball_features_set_colors]{basketball_features_set_colors()}}}

\item{rotation}{An angle, given in degrees, through which the plot should be
rotated}

convention, the +\code{x} axis extends from the center of the court towards
the right-hand basket when viewing the court in TV View}

\item{y_trans}{The amount that the \code{y} coordinates are to be shifted. By
convention, the +\code{y} axis extends from the center of the court towards
the top of the court when viewing the court in TV view}

\item{court_units}{The units with which to draw the court. The default is
\code{NULL}, which will apply the rule-book specified units}

\item{xlims}{The limits on the final display in the \code{x} direction. The
default is \code{NULL}, which will utilize the \code{xlims} specified by
the \code{display_range} parameter}
