\description{
The court apron is similar to the \code{\link[=basketball_court_apron]{basketball_court_apron()}} in that it is
the area outside the court. It may be the same color as the interior of the
court, but isn't necessarily. Unlike \code{\link[=basketball_court_apron]{basketball_court_apron()}} however, the
boundary line thickness doesn't matter since the lines are considered in-play
and therefore are included in the court's length and width. This is a colored
area inside of the free zone (see \code{\link[=volleyball_free_zone]{volleyball_free_zone()}}).
