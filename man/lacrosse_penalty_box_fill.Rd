The penalty boxes are the areas outside the confines of the field where
players serve time for a penalty incurred. They are to be on the same side of
the field surface and separate, as close to center field as possible, for
each team. This will not include the off-field officials' box; see
\code{\link[=lacrosse_off_field_officials_box]{lacrosse_off_field_officials_box()}} for more information
}
