\description{
The foul line. These are the white lines that extend from the back tip of
home plate (but not visibly through the batter's boxes) out to the fair/foul
pole in the outfield. Since a ball on the line is considered in fair
territory, the outer edge of the baseline must lie in fair territory (aka the
line y = +/- x)
