\description{
The goal crease is the area where a goaltender plays their position. It is
comprised of two components: the outline of the crease, and the filling in
its boundary (see \code{\link[=hockey_goal_crease_fill]{hockey_goal_crease_fill()}}). The goal crease may have two
notches (one on each side of the line y = 0)
}
\details{
The outline of the goal crease should have thickness given by
'minor_line_thickness', as this is a minor line on the ice surface, and the
outline is usually red in color
