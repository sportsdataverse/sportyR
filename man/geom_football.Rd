\usage{
geom_football(
  league,
  display_range = "full",
  field_updates = list(),
  color_updates = list(),
  rotation = 0,
  x_trans = 0,
  y_trans = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{league}{The league for which to draw the surface. This is
case-insensitive}

\item{display_range}{A case-insensitive string indicating the display range
to use for the plot. The default is \code{"full"}, which will be returned
when either an invalid or no value is passed to the function.

The possible display ranges are:

\describe{
\item{\code{"full"}}{The full field. This is the default}
\item{\code{"in_bounds_only"}}{The full in-bounds area of the field}
\item{\code{"in bounds only"}}{The full in-bounds area of the field}
\item{\code{"offense"}}{The TV-right half of the field}
\item{\code{"offence"}}{The TV-right half of the field}
\item{\code{"offensivehalffield"}}{The TV-right half of the field}
\item{\code{"offensive_half_field"}}{The TV-right half of the field}
\item{\code{"offensive half field"}}{The TV-right half of the field}
\item{\code{"defense"}}{The TV-left half of the field}
\item{\code{"defence"}}{The TV-left half of the field}
\item{\code{"defensivehalffield"}}{The TV-left half of the field}
\item{\code{"defensive_half_field"}}{The TV-left half of the field}
\item{\code{"defensive half field"}}{The TV-left half of the field}
\item{\code{"redzone"}}{
The offensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"red_zone"}}{
The offensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"red zone"}}{
The offensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"oredzone"}}{
The offensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"offensive_red_zone"}}{
The offensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"offensive red zone"}}{
The offensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"dredzone"}}{
The defensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"defensive_red_zone"}}{
The defensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
\item{\code{"defensive red zone"}}{
The defensive red zone of the field. This is by definition 20 yards
from the goal line
}
}}

\item{field_updates}{A list of updates to the field's parameters. These will
overwrite the parameters of the league}

\item{color_updates}{A list of updates to the field's default colors, which
are set by \code{\link[=football_features_set_colors]{football_features_set_colors()}}}

\item{rotation}{An angle, given in degrees, through which the plot should be
rotated}

\item{x_trans}{The amount that the \code{x} coordinates are to be shifted. By
convention, the +\code{x} axis extends from the center of the field towards
the right-hand endzone when viewing the field in TV View}

\item{y_trans}{The amount that the \code{y} coordinates are to be shifted. By
convention, the +\code{y} axis extends from the center of the field towards
the sideline when viewing the field in TV view}

\item{field_units}{The units with which to draw the field. The default is
\code{NULL}, which will apply the rule-book specified units}

\item{xlims}{The limits on the final display in the \code{x} direction. The
default is \code{NULL}, which will utilize the \code{xlims} specified by
the \code{display_range} parameter}

\item{ylims}{The limits on the final display in the \code{y} direction. The
default is \code{NULL}, which will utilize the \code{ylims} specified by
the \code{display_range} parameter}
}
