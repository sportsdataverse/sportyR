  goal_circle_radius = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{goal_frame_width}{The interior width of the goal frame's opening}

\item{line_thickness}{The thickness of the goal line}

\item{goal_line_full_diameter}{Whether or not the goal line should extend the

The goal line is where the front edge of the goal sits. It spans the entire
interior dimension of the goal mouth. Its anchoring \code{x} coordinate
should be its center (e.g. half of the line's width should be on each side of
the \code{x} anchor)
