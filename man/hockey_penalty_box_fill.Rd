The penalty boxes are the areas outside the confines of the rink where
players serve time for a penalty incurred. They are to be on the same side of
the ice surface and separate, as close to center ice as possible, for each
team. This will not include the off-ice officials' box; see
\code{\link[=hockey_off_ice_officials_box]{hockey_off_ice_officials_box()}} for more information
}
