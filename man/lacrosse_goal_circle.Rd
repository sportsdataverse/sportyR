\item{goal_circle_full_360}{A boolean indicating whether the goal circle
should be a 360 degree circle}

outer radius of the goal circle}

\description{
The goal circle is a circular feature on the field that houses the goal line
(see \code{\link[=lacrosse_goal_line]{lacrosse_goal_line()}}) and the goal. Notably, for fields with a
surrounding arc and/or fan around the goal area, this feature \emph{only}
circumscribes the goal. Those features will be handled separately. This
feature may either be the full circle (e.g. all 360 degrees), or a partial
circle that may be greater than a half-circle
