\description{
The backcourt is the area between the the attack line (see
\code{\link[=volleyball_attack_line]{volleyball_attack_line()}}) and the end line (see \code{\link[=volleyball_end_line]{volleyball_end_line()}}).
Players playing in the back row of the rotation must take off from this area
before attacking the ball. If considering the entirety of the volleyball
court as being divided into thirds, this is \emph{either} of the outer thirds of
the court
