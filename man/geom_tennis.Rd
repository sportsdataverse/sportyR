\usage{
geom_tennis(
  league,
  display_range = "full",
  court_updates = list(),
  color_updates = list(),
  rotation = 0,
  x_trans = 0,
  y_trans = 0,

  xlims = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{league}{The league for which to draw the surface. This is
case-insensitive}

\item{display_range}{A case-insensitive string indicating the display range
to use for the plot. The default is \code{"full"}, which will be returned
when either an invalid or no value is passed to the function.

The possible display ranges are:
\describe{
\item{\code{"full"}}{The full court. This is the default}
\item{\code{"in_bounds_only"}}{The full in-bounds area of the court}
\item{\code{"in bounds only"}}{The full in-bounds area of the court}
\item{\code{"serve"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"serving"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"servicehalf"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"service_half"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"service half"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"servinghalf"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"serving_half"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"serving half"}}{The serving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receive"}}{The receiving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receiving"}}{The receiving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receivicehalf"}}{The receiving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receivice_half"}}{The receiving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receivice half"}}{The receiving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receivinghalf"}}{The receiving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receiving_half"}}{The receiving half of the court}
\item{\code{"receiving half"}}{The receiving half of the court}
}}

\item{court_updates}{A list of updates to the courts' parameters. These will
overwrite the parameters of the league}

\item{color_updates}{A list of updates to the courts' default colors, which
are set by \code{\link[=tennis_features_set_colors]{tennis_features_set_colors()}}}

\item{rotation}{An angle, given in degrees, through which the plot should be
rotated}

\item{x_trans}{The amount that the \code{x} coordinates are to be shifted. By
convention, the +\code{x} axis extends from the center of the court towards
the right-hand serviceline when viewing the court in TV View}

\item{y_trans}{The amount that the \code{y} coordinates are to be shifted. By
convention, the +\code{y} axis extends from the center of the court towards
the sideline when viewing the court in TV view}

\item{court_units}{The units with which to draw the court. The default is
\code{NULL}, which will apply the rule-book specified units}

\item{xlims}{The limits on the final display in the \code{x} direction. The
default is \code{NULL}, which will utilize the \code{xlims} specified by
the \code{display_range} parameter}

\item{ylims}{The limits on the final display in the \code{y} direction. The
default is \code{NULL}, which will utilize the \code{ylims} specified by
the \code{display_range} parameter}
}
