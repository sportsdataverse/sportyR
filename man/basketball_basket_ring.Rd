  basket_ring_connector_width = 0,

}
\arguments{
\item{basket_ring_connector_width}{The width of the basket ring connector}

\item{backboard_face_to_ring_cent}{How far off the face of the backboard
the center of the basket ring's circle is located}

\item{basket_ring_inner_radius}{The inner radius of the circular part of the
basket ring}

\item{basket_ring_thickness}{The thickness of the basket ring's circular part}
}
\value{
A data frame of the boundary of the basket ring and connector
}
\description{
The hoop through which the ball must pass to score points for a team is
called the basket ring
}
\details{
An explanation of the math used to generate the basket ring (and its
connecting portion that attaches the ring to the backboard) is walked through
below using NBA dimensions, but is generalized in the code

The connector has a width of 7", so 3.5" are on each side of the x axis. The
ring has a radius of 9", so the arcsine of these measurements should give the
angle at which point the ring and connector connect
