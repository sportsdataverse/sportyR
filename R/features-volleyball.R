#' Volleyball Free Zone

#' court, but isn't necessarily. Unlike [basketball_court_apron()] however, the
#' boundary line thickness doesn't matter since the lines are considered in-play
#' and therefore are included in the court's length and width. This is not the
#' same as the [volleyball_court_apron()], as this is the entire area outside of
#' the court's lines, while the court apron corresponds to a colored apron
#' inside the free zone
